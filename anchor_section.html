            Web browsers are programs that read HTML and CSS instructions and then use those instructions to make web page content appear on a screen. Always write your HTML with the idea that people will view the content using a web browser. Web browsers request and display web pages that come from a web server on the Internet. But you can also display HTML pages you’ve saved on your own device before making them available on an Internet web server. When you develop your own HTML documents (web pages), you view those pages (called local pages) in your browser.
